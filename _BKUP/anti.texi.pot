"The requirement that @code{setq} and @code{setf} must be called with an even "
"number of arguments has been removed.  You can now call them with an odd "
"number of arguments, and Emacs will helpfully supply a @code{nil} for the "
"missing one.  Simplicity rules!"

"@kbd{M-x shell} and @kbd{M-x compile} set the @env{EMACS} environment "

"We have removed the @code{text-quoting-style} variable and the associated "
"functionality that translates quote characters in messages displayed to the "
"user and in help buffers.  Emacs now shows exactly the same quote characters "
"as you wrote in your code! Likewise, @code{substitute-command-keys} leaves "
"the quote characters alone.  As you move back in time, Unicode support "
"becomes less and less important, so no need to display those fancy new "
"quotes the Unicode Standard invented."

"Regular expressions have been simplified by removing support for Unicode "
"character properties in regexp classes.  As result, @code{[:alpha:]} and "
"@code{[:alnum:]} will match any character with a word syntax, and "
"@code{[:graph:]} and @code{[:print:]} will match any multibyte character, "
"including surrogates and unassigned codepoints.  Once again, this is in line "
"with diminishing importance of Unicode as you move back in time."

"The @code{pcase} form was significantly simplified by removing the UPatterns "

"@code{intangible}, @code{point-entered}, and @code{point-left} properties.  "
"The latter are implemented on a much lower level, and therefore are better "
"integrated with user expectations.  For similar reasons, "
"@code{cursor-intangible-mode} and @code{cursor-sensor-mode} were removed; "

"Due to excessive complexity and the diminishing need for Unicode support, "

"@code{string-equal} are so much more simple and yield predictable results "

"be useful in Emacs.  As result, the @file{ls-lisp.el} package sorts files in "
